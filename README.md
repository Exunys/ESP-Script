# ESP Script

### About

This Universal ESP Script creates a label above the Head of the opponent.
You can enable / disable the ESP by pressing Q. You can also change this keybind inside the script.
You can also edit different settings about the ESP Text, such as color, thickness, transparency, size, outline and team check.

This script shows the distance between you and the player, the name of the player and how much health the player has. The ESP looks something like : `(123) Name [100]`

- This script remains undetected and has been tested on games with an *Anti-Cheat* system.
- This script only works on exploits that support the API refrence **Drawing**.
